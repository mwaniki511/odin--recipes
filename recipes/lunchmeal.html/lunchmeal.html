      <h2>Buffalo Chicken Wrap</h2>
      <img src ="file:///C:/Users/ken/Desktop/repos/odin--recipes/recipes/images/buffalo-chicken-wrap1-1659123843.jpg">  
        <h3>A simple lunchmeal</h3>
        <p>When it comes to making a quick and delicious meal in minutes, 
          you can't go wrong with a wrap. While there are so many ways to fill
          and fold a tortilla (and we've been known to use them in everything 
          from a layered quesadilla cake to brunch-worthy tortilla French toast),
          this classic Buffalo chicken wrap is one that will absolutely keep you 
          coming back.</p>

          <p>Buffalo chicken wraps are stuffed with spicy Buffalo chicken 
          and a crunchy blue cheese slaw made with carrots and cabbage. 
          You'll make your own Buffalo sauce to coat the chicken, using oil, 
          hot sauce, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, cumin, and paprika. 
          It's a healthy-yet-flavor-packed way to enjoy chicken.</p>
          
          <p>This Buffalo chicken wrap is just as easy to customize as it is to make. 
          Feel free to adjust the spices to add more or less heat, swap out the slaw 
          for lettuce, the blue cheese sauce with ranch dressing, or use cauliflower or
          tofu instead of meat. For the mayo-haters out there, try Greek yogurt in 
          place of mayonnaise. If you're keto, there's no need to miss out. Instead,
          just substitute store-bought or homemade keto tortillas for the flour kind. 
          No matter how you stuff it, this recipe comes together in under an hour, 
          so making a quick lunch or dinner is basically…a wrap.</p>

          <h2>Copycat Wendy's Chili</h2>
          <img src ="file:///C:/Users/ken/Desktop/repos/odin--recipes/recipes/images/delish-wendys-chili-vertical-1538165572.jpg">
            <h3>A perfect chilli recipe</h3>
            <p>This is not only the perfect copycat recipe. It's the perfect chili 
              recipe, and we only have Dave and Wendy to thank for the inspiration! 
              If you're impatient, you don't have to simmer for a full 40 minutes. 
              Just know that the flavor gets better the longer it goes. We topped 
              it with scallions and cheese but feel free to use other delicious 
              stuff like tortilla strips, sour cream, or even fried shallots.</p>

              <p>Wendy’s chili recipe wasn’t an accident. It was one of the few 
              original menu items that stood loud and proud when the establishment 
              opened in 1969. Having chili on the menu along with burgers, fries,
              and milkshakes allowed this Wendy’s to stand out from other fast 
              food spots. Apparently one of the reasons chili was put on the menu 
              was to help eliminate food waste by using the leftover burger patties
              they were onto something.</p>
              
              <h5>How should I eat the chili?</h5>
              
              <p>You’re probably thinking about Wendy's baked potato, right? 
              This chili would make a great addition to any russet. 
              If you’re craving something crispy then top off your french fries 
              with chili and a sprinkle of cheddar. Chili cheese dogs are always
              a hit at game night or cookouts too! And, of course white rice is 
              always a good slate for something with a little spice.</p>
              
              <h5>Can chili be made in a slow cooker?</h5>
              
              <p>Chili is a great meal to make in a slow cooker. After the initial 
              stages of sauteing, everything cooks together in harmony on low 
              throughout the day. Make it in a crock pot if standing over the 
              stove doesn’t sound appealing.</p> 
              
              <h5>How long does this chili last?</h5>
              
              <p>After properly cooling, store your chili in an airtight container 
              in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. You could also freeze the 
              chili for a few weeks. When ready to eat, remove the chili from the
              freezer, thaw in the refrigerator overnight, and reheat slowly,
              adding a little bit of liquid to loosen it up.</p>
              <h4>Ingredients</h4>
              <p>Ensure that you have gathered these ingredients below:
                <ul>
                 <li>2 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil</li> 
                 <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
                 <li>1 medium green bell pepper, chopped</li>
                 <li>2 stalks celery, chopped</li>
                 <li>1 tbsp. tomato paste</li>

                 <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1 (28-oz.) can crushed tomatoes</li>
                <li>1 (15-oz.) can kidney beans, with liquid</li>
                <li>1 (15-oz.) can pinto beans, with liquid</li>
                <li>Shredded cheddar, for serving</li>
                <li>Green onions, sliced, for serving</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <h5>How to prepare this meal</h5>
              <p>Follow this steps below to make this perfect chilli meal:
                <ol>
                  <li>In a large pot over medium heat, heat oil. Add onion, pepper, and 
                    celery and cook until softened, 5 minutes. Add in tomato paste, stirring 
                    constantly until darker in color, about 2 minutes more. Add ground beef and 
                    cook, breaking up meat with a wooden spoon, until no longer 
                    pink, about 6 minutes more. Drain fat and return to heat.</li>
                  <li>Add chili powder, cumin, and garlic powder, and season generously 
                    with salt and pepper. Pour in crushed tomatoes, then fill can halfway 
                    with water, swirling to catch any remaining tomato, and add to pot. Add 
                    beans and their liquid and stir to combine. Bring chili to a boil then 
                    reduce heat to low and let simmer until flavors meld and liquid is slightly 
                    reduced, about 40 minutes. Taste and adjust seasonings as 
                    necessary.</li>
                  <li>Serve chili topped with cheddar and green onions.</li>
                </ol>
              </p>
