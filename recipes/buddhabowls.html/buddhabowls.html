    <h1>Buddha Bowls</h1>
    <img src ="file:///C:/Users/ken/Desktop/repos/odin--recipes/recipes/images/buddhabowls.jpg">
    <p>The beauty about grain bowls is that they're infinitely adaptable. 
      And this is certainly true for Buddha bowls! You can roast just about 
      any veggie, use any number of toppings and it'll taste amazing in this 
      recipe.</p>
    <p>We cook up some chicken but even there you can customize. We used tender 
      breasts but you can also switch that out for flavorful chicken thighs.
       Or you can skip the chicken and make a hearty beef Buddha bowl instead. 
       Toppings are also a free for all. You can use anything in your fridge or
       pantry such as kimchi, pickled sushi ginger or even crushed tortilla 
       chips.</p>
      <P>The only thing we might insist you must keep on the bowl is the 
        incredible peanut dressing. It's insanely addictive and one of our
         favorite sauces EVER.
