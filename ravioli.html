  <h1>One-Pan Ravioli Shakshuka</h1>
<img src="images/ravioli.jpg" alt="Ravioli SHakshuka"> 
  <p>Traditional shakshuka has runny eggs that have simmered in the warmly 
    spiced tomato sauce, but in this version we traded out the eggs for ravioli 
    and it's every bit as satisfying. It's the perfect version for dinner and 
    honestly, the pasta is a lot easier than stressing over getting that egg
    perfectly runny. Serve it with some crusty bread for swiping in the 
    sauce and you have the coziest weeknight dinner in about 30 minutes.
